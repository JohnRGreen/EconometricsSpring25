# Econometrics
This repo will contain materials for discussion section 1 of Johns Hopkins' Spring 2025 Econometrics course, 180.334, taught by professor Elena Krasnokutskaya. We meet at 4:30PM on Thursday and office hours are at 3pm on Tuesday. I am always happy to set up a Zoom meeting outside of those hours if necessary.

The "slides" folder contains the slides for each week's discussion. The "practice problems" folder contains the practice problems for each week; the solutions will also be posted once we have discussed them. Occasional extra materials will be posted in the "supplementary materials" folder. The "tex" folder contains the code that compiles the slides and the practice problems, and is not something students should worry about.

To submit a question or a topic that you would like covered in discussion section, please use [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdRYLxPSPHLikDVWhgGw2tzzXFQo52hZqL2_Krxj9dUmt3ozg/viewform?usp=header). This link will work for rolling submissions throughout the semester. But in general, please submit questions by Wednesday evening so that I have time to prepare before section.
